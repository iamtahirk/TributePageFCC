                            Abdul Sattar Edhi was born on February 28, 1928, in Bantva, Gujarat, British India
                            (present-day India) to a Memon family. From a young age, he was raised to be benevolent
                            towards the needy and the less privileged. In his biography, he said his mother would give
                            him 1 paisa for his meals and another to give to a poor/needy child. When Edhi was eleven
                            years old, his mother became paralysed from a stroke and died by the time he turned nineteen
                            in 1947. His personal experiences as a dedicated caretaker for his mother during her illness
                            drove him to develop a system of services for the old, mentally/physically ill and
                            challenged.

                            The partitioning of India led Edhi and his family to migrate to the
                            newly founded Pakistan. He shifted to Karachi to work in a wholesale market. He
                            initially started as a peddler, and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a
                            few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.

                            no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre.

                            Edhi began receiving numerous donations which allowed him to expand his services. To this

                            few doctors to cater to them. Determined to do the best he could, he begged for donations on
                            the streets to treat the growing number of patients and appealed to medical students to
                            volunteer their services.

                            lifestyle, owning only two pairs of clothes, never taking salary from his organization and
                            living in a small apartment next to his organization's office. He was described

                            would be on dialysis for the rest of his life unless he found a kidney donor. He later
                            died on 8 July 2016 at the age of 88 due to complete kidney failure after having been placed
                            on a ventilator. One of his last wishes was that his organs be donated for the use of the

                            donation. He was laid to rest at Edhi Village in Karachi.
